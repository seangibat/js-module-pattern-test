js-module-pattern-test
======================
This was given by MakerSquare as a tool to learn AJAX. As I had already had experience with AJAX, I took this opportunity to learn and use the JavaScript module pattern.

There are three modules. Display, Movie, and API. Display and API function as you would expect. Movie is the bridge between Display and API -- it caches the results and type of each API call such that they can be sorted.
